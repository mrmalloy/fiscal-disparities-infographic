<p>Since 1971, communities in the seven counties that make up the Twin Cities metropolitan area have participated in a property tax revenue-sharing program called Fiscal Disparities. The goal of the program is to encourage communities to pursue development that is more orderly, equitable, and friendly to non-revenue generating land uses. This is accomplished by pooling 40% of each community's commercial/industrial tax base growth since 1971, determining the average market value per person throughout the entire metro, and then redistributing income accordingly based on how each community's market value per person compares to the regional average. More information on Fiscal Disparities is available

<p>Map 1 shows the percent difference between the amount each community contributes to the regional commercial/industrial tax revenue pool and the amount that is distributed back to the community after the Fiscal Disparities formula is applied. Map 2 organizes the communities into three categories based on the results of the tax revenue redistribution and looks at the interplay between those categories and the median income for each community.</p>

<p>Because there are no obvious geographic patterns in the first two maps (at least not to someone unfamiliar with the region; locals would not be suprised to see the heavily-developed near suburbs of Minneapolis are among the greatest net contributors), I added a simple scatterplot showing median income against net change in tax revenue with points shaded to indicate each community's classification according the Thrive MSP 2040 regional plan. Toggling through the community options, one can see that the three community types that are predominantly net recipients (Emerging Suburban Edge, Rural Centers, and Rural Residential) might intuitively be thought of as the sort of communities that would be faced with a choice to pursue commercial/industrial development to increase their tax base.</p>
